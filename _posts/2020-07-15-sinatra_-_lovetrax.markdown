My second project is a sinatra named Love Trax. This application helps keep track of your love life.  A user will be able to rate and log their experiences . They will be able to edit , add and delete experiences. In the future I would like to grow this application into  one that  also keeps a picture and video tracking as well. 



Similar to my first project , my approach was one of hesitation. Instead of stressing , I took time to plan more trying to figure out how to approach . While making my way through the path of the project , speaking with others about the approach to take , many spoke of “Rubber Ducking .”  I want to take this approach when explaining  the process I took to understand and complete this project.


The framework of this Sinatra application is using the**Model-View-Controller/MVC** structure . The structure is positioned into three parts Models , Views, and Controllers.  **Models** work  like  the queen bee.  The queen bee doesn’t move but she controls everything around her , she makes the **Controllers** or working bees bring her the honey/views. The controllers are the connector between the views and models  bringing them together.** Views** are what we see , when looking at a beehive , we only see the  hive and honey.

	Once I was able to understand that , next was to put the “beehive” together.  There are conventions for the MVC folder structure.  This is the part I struggled with the most with  knowing that my application  name “Trax”  is a little difficult .  Again the queen bee “Models” is singular where tables , views,and controllers are plural when naming . The corneal gem also assisted with the file structure.



	The Corneal Gem also helped accomplish setting up CRUD. **CRUD is the ability to Create, Read, Update , and Delete within the application**.It gave me the direction needed to successfully stage my path for each option for my users. The users are only able to see and work on their entries, many people don’t like to share their love life.


	
	**Create:  Gives my user the ability to create new experiences on their most recent date. Once it is completed it will make a new entry on the “Experience” page.

**Read:  renders my show page , giving the current user the ability to look over the information submitted about their recent experience.**	

**Update: allows my user to update information about an experience just in case they want to change a number or name of the person they have the experience with.**

**Delete: Helps the user delete entries as they see fit but only under their username.**

While having the structure lay out for it , I still feel like there is more I can accomplish . I’ve learned alot  going through each step. My experiences with my system completely shutting down to it disconnecting my terminal ( where I wasn’t able to type at all) to the entire application breaking and spending four hours trying to get it back to  move forward.  I look forward to expanding as I stated before with LoveTrax  in the future.
