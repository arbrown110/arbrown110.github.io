 I’m Angel, I hail from the islands of South Carolina. I’m very big on learning new things about people , places , and things. Some people may say I know someone that does everything. I find myself being a resource to others so it only made sense that  dancing into code would be the path for me.
 
 
As a small child I helped my elementary school with IT work and assisting teachers with systems and portals.I’ve always found  art in everything becoming skilled in different art principals like  dance , poetry , playing instruments , and drawing. This passion also overflowed into student teaching and being a mentor to other students.

My path only broadened when I attended Winston-Salem State University, where I majored in Business Management with a minor in Music Business. The classes and experiences were loaded  with different systems and knowledge which helps me while I figure out how to take different coding principles  related to my life. I didn’t have the opportunity to take the MIS path in college , due to the demand by other students wanting to be in the program. 


The passion for knowledge and systems  led me here . Prior to me being accepted into the program I completed a 21 day challenge through Career Karma. This pushed me into the world of code , and topics I never thought of before. The support of my mentors and others in the challenge ,I’m able to embark on this next adventure into software programming.
