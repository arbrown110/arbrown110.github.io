My final project for Flatiron is Called Exodus. It is a  theme surrounding taking a trip to Sierra Leone. The user is able to record their travels focusing on journaling different topics like Historical sites they may visit , Beaches ,Food they had that day, and phrases that helped navigate with locals. It is inspired by a tip that I am going to take  due to research i’ve previously done about my family and our heritage that pre-dates slavery.I am hoping to add more feautres in the future that will include others with user capabilities. 

The instructions for the project included making  an application with a React-Redux frontend and a Rails backend. We also had to include components  , at least three routes , while making sure you are using middleware just to name a few of the parameters for the project. It didn’t seem like it would take long to complete but once most of us in my cohort got to the middle of the project it felt like quick sand. It was a true test of patience and doubting abilities.
