Starting my first CLI , as like many others , may haunt me in my sleep or a few months. I’ve cried , laughed , kicked and screamed . At times I felt as if maybe this was not the path for me . Working full-time , staying up all night ,and repeating has left me with sleepy eyes. Through all of the stress , I feel like I over reacted . Also realizing that I know more than I thought. For the first few days I struggled to connect my external environment to start my project. This also opened up my eyes to the different struggles of learning a new system . I felt like I was dropped off in another country with no knowledge of what not to do. After the breakdowns I mentioned earlier, I made some strides in getting my project  to run.

The next step was taking all of the knowledge collected over these first 6-7 weeks to build an application that may last only one  minute. I have a newfound respect for any and everyone  before me . It was one of the best action movies I’ve ever experienced and the journey is only in the beginning.


My CLI project is based on the  Spooncular website  , creating Foodies. Foodies was created to assist users with selecting dishes from their favorite categories of cuisines. The user is able to select a cuisine , see a list of 10 dishes,and pick the dish they would like to learn more about them.There are commands and capabilities to move forward and back within the system to find different dishes based on their needs.



Over the course of finishing my project I realized that the order in which my placement of code has alot to do with the results that I am able to receive . From the very beginning of setting up an local environment to connecting it to github correctly. I know that there is alot more that I must learn to be able to be successful.
