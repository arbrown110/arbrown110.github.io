HomeComing  is a way to pay homage  on a small scale to the homecoming season for Colleges and Universities. Users are able to  represent their school and add a soundtrack to match their Homecoming mood. Unfortunately , due to the recent pandemic we are not able to share with each other physically but through the playlist created we are able to connect musically in Homecoming fashion.

The main focus and guidelines of building this application was  immersed Model relationships. Being able to build a has_many and has_many through  relationship that has more than foriegn keys as the connector. 

The three that were used were ;

Has_many : This association indicated that one model holds more than one instance with the related model . It is similar to having a half sibling. There is one biological parent and one other parent that is outside of your home structure.

Has_many Through: This association indicates that the model has instances of another model by proceeding through outside a model .An example is having a friend that you only know because of your best friend. Without your relationship with your best friend, the original connection or association doesn’t/ didn’t exist. 

Belongs_to : This parent association has ownership of one instance in connection with another model. It may only be used in it’s singular term  and will not properly connect with the other model if it is in a pluralized form. 
 


College and University Homecoming  events make the best example of model associations . These associations connect your models and give them access to one another without having to write out each association by hand when coding. In exchange, giving you access to all of their attributes or picking out which association is best. 


The biggest point of Homecoming is to connect with people who share a common interest , which is pride and love for your College/University. There are events where you can network with Alumni from different generations as well as connect back with the same people you attended school with. You share information , experiences , celebrate ,and revoice for your journey on those grounds.
